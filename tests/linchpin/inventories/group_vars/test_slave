# This is a very convoluted set of variables, but it allows us to pull out the host information
# from the dynamically provisioned host information. Since Linchpin does not allow us to give
# a deterministic Ansible name to the system, at present
# (https://github.com/CentOS-PaaS-SIG/linchpin/issues/332), we must first extract the host
# from its position in the set of jenkins_master systems. Then we can extract the values from
# that set of hostvars in order to construct the jenkins_master_url that is being spun up by
# our system
