This file spins up a pair of Jenkins master and slave instances
running RHEL8.  They will be based on a rhel8.0 box.

You will still need to modify the Vagrantfile to update the value
of the rhel_base variable to point to the base directory of your
available RHEL8 repositories. Since those files are also under
license, you will need to have access to such a repository in order
for the Ansible playbooks to properly install the software.
